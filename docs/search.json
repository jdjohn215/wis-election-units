This document is an explanation and tutorial on how to do that.\nFollow along in the associated Github repository for data and code."

    "text": "Wards are the most basic building block of the election system. All land in the state, populated or otherwise, must be assigned to a ward. When preparing to vote, you look up your ward’s polling place. All the other residents of your ward share the same elected officials, so the ballots for everyone living in the ward are identical.11 Sometimes this isn’t true. For instance, a special election for a Milwaukee Aldermanic seat took place during the Spring 2023 election. The entire Spring election was held under the new wards drawn during the 2021 redistricting cycle. The new Aldermanic districts don’t formally take effect until 2024, so the special election was technically held for the version of the district drawn in 2011. This caused some wards to be split, meaning that people living in the same ward had to receive different ballots based on whether they lived in the 2011 version of the aldermanic district or not. Another exception involves school districts, which are allowed to straddle ward lines.\nIn Wisconsin, official election results are not reported by ward. Rather, they are officially tabulated by “reporting unit.” Under specific, but common, conditions, local administrators can combine multiple adjacent wards into a single reporting unit. All the wards in a reporting unit must have identical races on the ballot during that election. Only municipalities with populations below 35,000 are allowed to create multi-ward reporting units. For larger municipalities, each reporting unit is a single ward.\nThe Wisconsin Election Commission publishes what they call “Ward by Ward Report” files, but this is a misnomer. Really, they are “Reporting unit by Reporting unit” results. The official results look something like this."

    "text": "Where can I get updated ward boundaries?\nThe Wisconsin Legislative Technology Services Bureau (LTSB) collects updated municipal and ward boundary information from local governments twice a years, in January and July. Unfortunately, these dates do not exactly correspond with elections, which generally occur in January, April, August, and November. It’s not uncommon for wards to be referenced in the names of reporting units which do not exist in the most recent vintage of the LTSB ward GIS file.\nIf you’re trying to find ward polygons right after an election, I recommend starting with the most recent LTSB file. If you identify inconsistencies between the list of wards referenced in the reporting unit names and the actual wards existing in the LTSB file, your best option is to visit the problem county’s “Land Information Office.” Literally, google “[COUNTY NAME] LAND INFORMATION OFFICE.” Sometimes, the updated ward boundary file will be available to download off the county LIO website. If not, try emailing or calling the office and asking for “a GIS file containing the ward boundaries used in the [MONTH YEAR] election.”"

    "text": "Disaggregating reporting units to wards\nThe LTSB disaggregates the reporting unit results of each partisan election into individual wards using a methodology described in detail here. Basically, they rely on their most recent ward layer and use census-derived population estimates to come up with disaggregation factors. They also use sensible workarounds for edge cases that occur when the wards referenced by an election’s reporting units are inconsistent with the wards in their latest statewide file.\nThe LTSB also uses a similar methodology to disaggregate prior election results with different ward boundaries into the current ward boundary map. This methodology has great advantages for researchers who need consistent units of analysis across time.\nA disadvantage to disaggregated wards is that the information presented is not literally accurate. It should be close enough for statistical analysis purposes, but sometimes the researcher’s primary interest is actually presenting the official, legal election results."

In certain kinds of research projects, it may also aid overall accuracy to use wholly accurate, non-disaggregated election returns."
