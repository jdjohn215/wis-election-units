    "text": "In America, elections are mostly administred by local governments with varying degrees of standardization enforced by the state and federal governments. In a state like wisconsin, analyzing election results requires combining data across a variety of sources. This document is an explanation and tutorial on how to do that.\nFollow along in the associated Github repository for data and code.\nI’ve accumulated the information in these pages from working closely with Wisconsin election data over the past 7 years. I’m grateful to the many local and state election workers who’ve written documentation or responded to my calls and emails. Any errors contained within are mine alone. If you something wrong, please send an email to john.d.johnson@marquette.edu.\nThis is a living document, which I plan to update with additional content in the future."

    "text": "Wards are the most basic building block of the election system. All land in the state, populated or otherwise, must be assigned to a ward. When preparing to vote, you look up your ward’s polling place. All the other residents of your ward share the same elected officials, so the ballots for everyone living in the ward are identical.11 Sometimes this isn’t true. For instance, a special election for a Milwaukee Aldermanic seat took place during the Spring 2023 election. The entire Spring election was held under the new wards drawn during the 2021 redistricting cycle. The new Aldermanic districts don’t formally take effect until 2024, so the special election was technically held for the version of the district drawn in 2011. This caused some wards to be split, meaning that people living in the same ward had to receive different ballots based on whether they lived in the 2011 version of the aldermanic district or not. Another exception involves school districts, which are allowed to straddle ward lines.\nIn Wisconsin, official election results are not reported by ward. Rather, they are officially tabulated by “reporting unit.” Under specific, but common, conditions, local administrators can combine multiple adjacent wards into a single reporting unit. All the wards in a reporting unit must have identical races on the ballot during that election. Only municipalities with populations below 35,000 are allowed to create multi-ward reporting units. For larger municipalities, each reporting unit is a single ward.\nThe Wisconsin Election Commission publishes what they call “Ward by Ward Report” files, but this is a misnomer. Really, they are “Reporting unit by Reporting unit” results. The official results look something like this."

    "text": "Where can I get updated ward boundaries?\nThe Wisconsin Legislative Technology Services Bureau (LTSB) collects updated municipal and ward boundary information from local governments twice a years, in January and July. Unfortunately, these dates do not exactly correspond with elections, which generally occur in January, April, August, and November. It’s not uncommon for wards to be referenced in the names of reporting units which do not exist in the most recent vintage of the LTSB ward GIS file.\nIf you’re trying to find ward polygons right after an election, I recommend starting with the most recent LTSB file. If you identify inconsistencies between the list of wards referenced in the reporting unit names and the actual wards existing in the LTSB file, your best option is to visit the problem county’s “Land Information Office.” Literally, google “[COUNTY NAME] LAND INFORMATION OFFICE.” Sometimes, the updated ward boundary file will be available to download off the county LIO website. If not, try emailing or calling the office and asking for “a GIS file containing the ward boundaries used in the [MONTH YEAR] election.”"

    "text": "Disaggregating reporting units to wards\nThe LTSB disaggregates the reporting unit results of each partisan election into individual wards using a methodology described in detail here. Basically, they rely on their most recent ward layer and use census-derived population estimates to come up with disaggregation factors. They also use sensible workarounds for edge cases that occur when the wards referenced by an election’s reporting units are inconsistent with the wards in their latest statewide file.\nThe LTSB also uses a similar methodology to disaggregate prior election results with different ward boundaries into the current ward boundary map. This methodology has great advantages for researchers who need consistent units of analysis across time.\nA disadvantage to disaggregated wards is that the information presented is not literally accurate. It should be close enough for statistical analysis purposes, but sometimes the researcher’s primary interest is actually presenting the official, legal election results."

    "text": "Aggregating wards to reporting units\nEspecially given the increasingly fraught public rhetoric around election integrity, I often find it preferable to present the official election data as accurately as possible. In certain kinds of research projects, it may also aid overall accuracy to use wholly accurate, non-disaggregated election returns.\nTo create reporting unit shapefiles, follow these steps:\n\nSelect the ward GIS file from the time period closest to the election you want to map.\nIdentify the individual wards which make up each reporting unit.\nMatch those wards to the GIS file, keeping the reporting unit name as an additional field.\nGroup by the reporting unit name, and dissolve the constituent ward polygons into a larger reporting unit polygon.\n\nHere is an example, using Milwaukee County data from the 2020 presidential election.\nThe official election results look like this.\n\n\nShow the code\npres20\n\n\n# A tibble: 476 × 5\n   county_fips reporting_unit                  total biden trump\n   <chr>       <chr>                           <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 55079       Village of BAYSIDE Wards 1,3     1049   719   323\n 2 55079       Village of BAYSIDE Wards 1S,3S     71    47    24\n 3 55079       Village of BAYSIDE Wards 2,4     1253   910   327\n 4 55079       Village of BAYSIDE Ward 5         706   508   192\n 5 55079       Village of BROWN DEER Wards 1-2  2494  1892   553\n 6 55079       Village of BROWN DEER Wards 3-4  2489  1683   771\n 7 55079       Village of BROWN DEER Wards 5-6  2480  1750   686\n 8 55079       Village of FOX POINT Wards 1-4   2202  1533   641\n 9 55079       Village of FOX POINT Wards 5-9   2790  1959   788\n10 55079       Village of GREENDALE Wards 1-2   1765   824   916\n# … with 466 more rows\n\n\nThe wards look like this\n\n\nShow the code\nward.shp.2020\n\n\n# A tibble: 570 × 3\n   county_fips ward_name                                                geometry\n   <chr>       <chr>                                          <MULTIPOLYGON [°]>\n 1 55079       Bayside - V 1    (((-87.90525 43.17631, -87.90575 43.17631, -87.…\n 2 55079       Bayside - V 1S   (((-87.90774 43.17631, -87.90808 43.17631, -87.…\n 3 55079       Bayside - V 2    (((-87.90501 43.18393, -87.90482 43.18392, -87.…\n 4 55079       Bayside - V 3    (((-87.91764 43.1921, -87.91694 43.19213, -87.9…\n 5 55079       Bayside - V 3S   (((-87.92205 43.19104, -87.9222 43.19104, -87.9…\n 6 55079       Bayside - V 4    (((-87.89894 43.1922, -87.89815 43.19217, -87.8…\n 7 55079       Bayside - V 5    (((-87.90113 43.17482, -87.90125 43.1751, -87.9…\n 8 55079       Brown Deer - V 1 (((-87.95951 43.18644, -87.95919 43.1862, -87.9…\n 9 55079       Brown Deer - V 2 (((-87.98452 43.17997, -87.98452 43.18014, -87.…\n10 55079       Brown Deer - V 3 (((-87.99448 43.17787, -87.99448 43.17837, -87.…\n# … with 560 more rows\n\n\nThe next step is to extract the individual wards from each reporting unit.

These ward-level files are published by the Wisconsin Election Commission showing totals usually on the first day of each month.\nThis ward-level data runs into the same caveats described in the previous section. To directly compare these numbers with election results, you would first need to aggregate the wards into the reporting units used in that specific election. Ward boundaries can change in ways that make these comparisons difficult or impossible.\nAnother problem is that none of the monthly registered voter files directly correspond to the Election Day universe of registered voters, as none of Wisconsin’s various election days falls on the first of a month. Moreover, Wisconsin still maintains same-day registration. You can show up at your local polling place, register, and immediately cast a ballot. As a result, many wards end election day with more registered voters than they began it with. In places with a highly transient population, like college campuses, the number of election day registrants can be very high.\nAlso, the state’s registration system works hard to transfer the identify of registered voters when they move within the state. If you are registered in Oshkosh, move to Appleton, and then register at your new polling place on Election Day, the state will transfer your old voter registration in their database. This prevents an individual voter from being registered in two places at once. It also means that same day registration can actually reduce the number of registered voters in a ward versus what it held entering election day.\nFor all these reasons, it’s better to use the registered voter file from the first day of the month following the election than it is from the first day of the month containing the election day."

No one in Wisconsin can register to vote on the Saturday, Sunday, or Monday before the election on Tuesday. I believe this rule is to give administrators time to print the voter rolls for each ward.\nElection Day Registrants - includes everybody who registers to vote on election day\n\nBy adding these three columns, you can get a figure of total registered voters for each reporting unit which includes election day registrants."
