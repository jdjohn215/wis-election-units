The two `.geojson` files in this directory are disaggregated ward returns from the Legislative Technology Services Bureau (LTSB).

The files in the `official-wec/` subdirectory are official reporting-unit-level election results files retrieved either from the website for the Wisconsin Elections Commission or their digital archive at the Wisconsin Historical Society.

`OriginalWEC_Pres-GOV_2012-2022_ReportingUnits.csv` combines all the governor and president results in `official-wec/` into a single file. The file contains 1 row per reporting unit in each election. **The reporting units are the original value and are not necessarily comparable over time. In particular, the 2022 reporting units are completely uncomparable with the previous reporting units.**
