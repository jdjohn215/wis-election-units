# block-assignment

The `block-assignment` subdirectory includes official Census Bureau files showing which larger geography each census block was assigned to *at the time of the census*. The assignment files only include the numeric codes for each geography, so I also include the official name lookup tables, which contain the text labels for each numeric code. Both kinds of tables are included for the 2010 and 2020 decennial censuses.

The block assignment files can be downloaded through [this Census Bureau web interface](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/block-assignment-files.html).

The name lookup files can be downloaded through [this Census Bureau web interface](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/name-lookup-tables.2010.html#list-tab-2098172819).

# block relationships

The file `tab2010_tab2020_st55_wi.txt` contains the official relationships (i.e. degree of overlap) between 2010 and 2020 census blocks. The file was downloaded from [this Census Bureau web page](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/relationship-files.2020.html#list-tab-1709067297).
